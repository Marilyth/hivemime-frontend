# hivemind
Idea dump:

An SNS designed around each post being a poll

- Polls need tags, kind of like subreddits
  - Tags get recommended from existing ones
- Polls have a comment section and description
- Polls can have media
- Users can follow tags, users or keywords
- Has a recommendation system based on followed tags, correlation between tags, hot polls
  - Can be used anonymous without account, or with account and recommendations
- Polls can be sorted by popularity
  - Hot polls are recommended more often
- People who make hot posts are recommended more often
- Polls can be provided as a continuous feed, or searched for by filters
  - Might need proximity search via embeddings
